Everything went from bad to worse money never changed a thing
 Death kept followin trackin us down at least I heard your bluebird sing
 Now somebodys got to show their hand time is an enemy
 I know youre long gone I guess it must be up to me
 
 If Id thought about it I never wouldve done it I guess I wouldve let it slide
 If Id lived my life by what others were thinkin the heart inside me wouldve died
 I was just too stubborn to ever be governed by enforced insanity
 Someone had to reach for the risin star I guess it was up to me
 
 Oh the Union Central is pullin out and the orchids are in bloom
 Ive only got me one good shirt left and it smells of stale perfume
 In fourteen months Ive only smiled once and I didnt do it consciously
 Somebodys got to find your trail I guess it must be up to me
 
 It was like a revelation when you betrayed me with your touch
 Id just about convinced myself that nothin had changed that much
 The old Rounder in the iron mask slipped me the master key
 Somebody had to unlock your heart he said it was up to me
 
 Well I watched you slowly disappear down into the officers club
 I wouldve followed you in the door but I didnt have a ticket stub
 So I waited all night til the break of day hopinone of us could get free
 When the dawn came over the river bridge I knew it was up to me
 
 Oh the only decent thing I did when I worked as a postal clerk
 Was to haul your picture down off the wall near the cage where I used to work
 Was I a fool or not to try to protect your identity
 You looked a little burned out my friend I thought it might be up to me
 
 Well I met somebody face to face and I had to remove my hat
 Shes everything I need and love but I cant be swayed by that
 It frightens me the awful truth of how sweet life can be
 But she aint a gonna make me move I guess it must be up to me
 
 We heard the Sermon on the Mount and I knew it was too complex
 It didnt amount to anything more than what the broken glass reflects
 When you bite off more than you can chew you pay the penalty
 Somebodys got to tell the tale I guess it must be up to me
 
 Well Dupree came in pimpin tonight to the Thunderbird Café
 Crystal wanted to talk to him I had to look the other way
 Well I just cant rest without you love I need your company
 But you aint a gonna cross the line I guess it must be up to me
 
 Theres a note left in the bottle you can give it to Estelle
 Shes the one you been wondrin about but theres really nothin much to tell
 We both heard voices for a while now the rest is history
 Somebodys got to cry some tears I guess it must be up to me
 
 So go on boys and play your hands life is a pantomime
 The ringleaders from the county seat say you dont have all that much time
 And the girl with me behind the shades she aint my property
 One of us has got to hit the road I guess it must be up to me
 
 And if we never meet again baby remember me
 How my lone guitar played sweet for you that old time melody
 And the harmonica around my neck I blew it for you free
 No one else could play that tune you know it was up to me
