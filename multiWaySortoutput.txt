Initial Order of the Words: 
everything went from bad to worse money never changed a thing 
death kept followin trackin us down at least i heard 
your bluebird sing now somebodys got to show their hand 
time is an enemy i know youre long gone i 
guess it must be up to me if id thought 
about it i never wouldve done it i guess i 
wouldve let it slide if id lived my life by 
what others were thinkin the heart inside me wouldve died 
i was just too stubborn to ever be governed by 
enforced insanity someone had to reach for the risin star 
i guess it was up to me oh the union 
central is pullin out and the orchids are in bloom 
ive only got me one good shirt left and it 
smells of stale perfume in fourteen months ive only smiled 
once and i didnt do it consciously somebodys got to 
find your trail i guess it must be up to 
me it was like a revelation when you betrayed me 
with your touch id just about convinced myself that nothin 
had changed that much the old rounder in the iron 
mask slipped me the master key somebody had to unlock 
your heart he said it was up to me well 
i watched you slowly disappear down into the officers club 
i wouldve followed you in the door but i didnt 
have a ticket stub so i waited all night til 
the break of day hopinone of us could get free 
when the dawn came over the river bridge i knew 
it was up to me oh the only decent thing 
i did when i worked as a postal clerk was 
to haul your picture down off the wall near the 
cage where i used to work was i a fool 
or not to try to protect your identity you looked 
a little burned out my friend i thought it might 
be up to me well i met somebody face to 
face and i had to remove my hat shes everything 
i need and love but i cant be swayed by 
that it frightens me the awful truth of how sweet 
life can be but she aint a gonna make me 
move i guess it must be up to me we 
heard the sermon on the mount and i knew it 
was too complex it didnt amount to anything more than 
what the broken glass reflects when you bite off more 
than y
