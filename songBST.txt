
Well it aint no use to sit and wonder why babe
If in you dont know by now
An it aint no use to sit and wonder why babe
Itll never do some how
When your rooster crows at the break a dawn
Look out your window and Ill be gone
Youre the reason Im travelin on
Dont think twice its all right

And it aint no use in a turnin on your light babe
The light I never knowed
An it aint no use in turnin on your light babe
Im on the dark side of the road
But I wish there was somethin you would do or say
To try and make me change my mind and stay
We never did too much talkin anyway
But dont think twice its all right


No it aint no use in callin out my name gal
Like you never done before
And it aint no use in callin out my name gal
I cant hear ya any more
Im a thinkin and a wonderin wallkin way down the road
I once loved a woman a child I am told
I give her my heart but she wanted my soul
But dont think twice its all right

So long honey babe
Where Im bound I cant tell
Goodbye is too good a word babe
So I just say fare thee well
I aint sayin you treated me unkind
You could have done better but I dont mind
You just kinda wasted my precious time
But dont think twice its all right
